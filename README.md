# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay with a bank using deep learning (ANN).   It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA)  and a  TensorFlow-based neural network model to identify key churn drivers such as age, tenure, credit score, balance, and activity status.
